This is a 101 demo for building scalable web applications using HCloud Solutions such as HLB, H53, SONAR, H2O and etc. 

This is an 101 level for users who wish to build a scalable web application but do not know how to get started with HCloud.

The demo application takes advantage of the various solutions offered by HCloud such as Hyundai Load Balancer (HLB-CLB), Object Block Storage (H2O), as well as SONAR (Monitoring Solution). By using HCloud we are making things easier so that an user with a little experience with HCloud or Cloud world can easily finish this in a couple of hours. If you are building a scalable web application on your own infrastructure or on another public cloud like AWS, the workaround should be the same but the actual implementation might be somewhat different.
